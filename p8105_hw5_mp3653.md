Problem 1
=========

### Load Data and Create Dataset

``` r
#file paths and file names
study = tibble(file_path = list.files('./data/', pattern = '*.csv', full.names = TRUE), file_name = basename(file_path))
```

### Creating function to read in data

``` r
read_data = function(data){
  
  read_csv(file = data)
  
}
```

### Read in the data

``` r
study_data = study %>%
  mutate(obs = map(file_path, read_data))
```

### Tidy data

``` r
study_data = study_data %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = value, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  mutate(id = str_replace(file_name, '.csv',''),
         week = as.numeric(str_replace(week, 'week_', ''))) %>% 
  separate(id, into = c('group', 'id'), sep = '_') %>% 
  mutate(group = str_replace(group, 'con', 'control'),
         group = str_replace(group, 'exp', 'exposed')) %>% 
  select(-file_path, -file_name)
```

### Spaghetti plot of data

``` r
study_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~group) +
  labs(
    title = 'Exposed vs. Control Over 8 Week Period'
  )
```

![](p8105_hw5_mp3653_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png) Over the 8 week period, there is a general increase in values for the exposed group while for the control group the values remain relatively the same.

Problem 2
=========

### Import and Clean Data

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  unite(city_state, c(city, state), sep = ", ", remove = FALSE)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The `homicide_data` dataset contains 52179 rows of observations for 50 US cities. There are 13 variables in the dataset, giving the date of the event, victim info (name, race, age, and sex), and location (city, state, and long + lat). There is also a variable `disposition` describing the current status of the investigation into the homicide.

Total number of homicides and unsolved homicides

``` r
homicide_data_new = homicide_data %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  mutate(total_homicides = n()) %>% 
  filter(disposition %in% c('Closed without arrest', 'Open/No arrest')) %>%
  mutate(unsolved_homicides = n()) %>% 
  select(city_state, unsolved_homicides, total_homicides) %>% 
  distinct()
```

``` r
baltimore = homicide_data_new %>% 
  filter(city_state == 'Baltimore, MD')

prop_baltimore = prop.test(baltimore[[2]], baltimore[[3]]) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>%  
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

prop_baltimore
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663
